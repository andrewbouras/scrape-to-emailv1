Well-controlled mild depression is allowed\n* Total bilirubin \u2265 34 \u00b5mol/L (or \u2265 2 mg/dL) unless subject has a documented history of Gilbert's disease\n* Confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Confirmed albumin \\< 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L)\n* Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) \\> 100 ng/mL OR \u2265 50 and \u2264 100 ng/mL requires a liver ultrasound and subjects with findings suspicious of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are excluded\n* Confirmed hemoglobin \\< 8.5 g/dL\n* Confirmed ANC \\< 0.5 x 10(9) cells/L\n* Confirmed platelet count \\< 50,000 cells/mm3"
